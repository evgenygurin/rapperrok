- No breaking changes to public API

## Benefits
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Users now have extensive guides and tutorials
2. **Better Onboarding**: Clear getting started guides and examples
3. **Feature Clarity**: Feature matrix shows exactly what's implemented
4. **API Coverage**: Complete transparency on API implementation status
5. **Professional Structure**: MkDocs site ready for deployment
6. **URL Consistency**: All URLs standardized to official endpoints

## Review Notes
This is a documentation-heavy PR that doesn't change core functionality. The main code changes are:
- URL standardization
- Configuration file updates
- Enhanced examples

All merge conflicts were resolved to maintain consistency with the latest main branch standards.

## Next Steps
After merging, we can:
1. Deploy MkDocs documentation site
2. Continue adding tutorials based on user feedback
3. Keep documentation in sync with API updates
